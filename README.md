## Getting Started

Detailed implementation guides, API documentation, and development resources are available in the respective contract directories:

- `/contracts/donation-management`
- `/contracts/project-milestone`
- `/contracts/expense-verification`
- `/contracts/impact-measurement`

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on [blockchain technology/framework] with smart contracts written in [programming language]. The system uses a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture to balance transparency, privacy, and cost efficiency, with sensitive data stored off-chain with cryptographic verification.

## Security and Privacy

The platform implements robust security and privacy measures:

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive beneficiary information
- Role-based access controls for different stakeholders
- Comprehensive audit logs for all system interactions
- Regular security audits by third-party specialists
- GDPR and international privacy regulation compliance
- Secure key management and multi-factor authentication

## Integration Capabilities

The platform offers multiple integration options:

- REST APIs for existing charity management systems
- CSV/Excel data import/export functionality
- Mobile apps for field data collection
- Public data feeds for transparency initiatives
- Integration with existing donation platforms
